## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking [the main repository](LINK_TO_MAIN_REPO).
2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```
4. **Add Upstream Remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
   ```
5. **Install Dependencies**: (This step may vary based on the project. Here's a general example)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Finding Issues to Work On

- Check out the "Good First Issues" label in the issues tab of the main repository.
- Once you find an issue you'd like to work on, comment on the issue expressing your interest.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Update Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main main
   ```
2. **Create a New Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name
   ```
3. **Make Your Changes**.
4. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
5. Navigate to the GitHub page of your fork, and click on "New Pull Request".
6. Ensure the base branch is the main branch of the main repository, and the compare branch is your branch with changes.
